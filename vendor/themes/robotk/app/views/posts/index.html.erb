      <p>I like beer. Not in the “hey, weren’t there two dozen cans in this box not long ago” kind of way, but I do enjoy both the taste and the attendant social experience when drinking among people with a similar attitude to alcohol consumption. But.</p>
      <p>Imagine for a moment that I am walking along the street drinking beer from a bottle. (In fact, this is something you can only imagine, because it’s illegal in Christchurch.) After drinking most of the beer, I throw the bottle on the ground and kick it about a bit, leaving a little splattering of beer across the footpath and a lingering hoppy odour, before walking off and continuing with my day.</p>
      <p>This is completely mad behaviour, right? And yet, this is what cigarette smokers do, sometimes many times a day.</p>
